# Navie Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes classifier is a straightforward and powerful algorithm for the classification task. Even if we are working on a data set with millions of records with some attributes, it is suggested to try Naive Bayes approach.

- Supervise learning algorithm.
- Assumes an underlying probabilistic model.
- Gives categorical result.
- Best for textual data analysis.
